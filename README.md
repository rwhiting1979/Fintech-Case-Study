### Overview of Chainalysis
Headquartered out of New York, New York, Chainalysis was co-founded by Michael Gronager and Jonathan Levin in 2014. Chainalysis is a blockchain data platform that provides data, software, services, and research to government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions, and insurance and cybersecurity companies. Their data powers investigation, compliance, and market intelligence software that has been used to solve some of the world’s most high-profile criminal cases and grow consumer access to cryptocurrency safely. The top competitors of Chainalysis are 6clicks, Tessian, Tookitaki, and Ascent.

The firm’s data platform has been used to solve high-profile criminal cases involving digital assets, including the seizure of $3.5 billion of crypto by the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation unit, announced in November 2020, and the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack. Chainalysis now screens over $1 trillion in transaction value each month across all cryptocurrency assets.

Feeback from clients has been that Chainalysis provides great solutions for gathering information about customer transactions. Transactions can be divided based on risk categories and can be checked individually to determine customer full exposure.  Chainalysis has a support staff that is always available to assist clients with questions as well as provide training for use of their data platform.  Additional feedback from clients is that the User Interface can be improved on as it is not so user friendly.

Going into 2023, Chainalysis will continue to be the leader in RegTech.  Over the past year, Chainalysis has increased its customer base by 75% and now has more than 750 clients in 70 countries.  Their latest valuation was at $8.6 billion.
